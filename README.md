# Machine learning tasks
Homework assignments for the course Intelligent Systems (SPbU, 7th semester)

### Task 1
**Dataset**: Facebook Comment Volume Dataset.  
Predict how many comments a post will receive. The task involves the implementation of gradient descent and the calculation of metrics for evaluating the quality of the model. Solution steps:

* cross-validation for five folds and linear regression training;  
* R^2 and RMSE calculation.  

Local run: `python main.py <number of data variants>`
