# Machine learning tasks
Homework assignments for the course Intelligent Systems (SPbU, 7th semester)

### Task 1
Dataset: Facebook Comment Volume Dataset.  
Predict how many comments a post will receive. The task involves the implementation of gradient descent and the calculation of metrics for evaluating the quality of the model.  
Solution steps:  
* normalization of feature values;  
* cross-validation for five folds and linear regression training;  
* RMSE calculation.  
Local run: `python main.py <number of data variants>`  
There is also a **sgd.ipynb**.
